# WP Motivator
Add a touch of personal motivation to your WordPress site.

This project was inspired by the WP Innovator and Agency Trailblazer communities. Much of the motivational content was supplied by members of these communities. Thank you, all.

## Overview
This WordPress plugin adds words of motivation to your admin pages in a variety of places. The features can be individually disabled or customized. User roles can be applied to the overall application of the plugin features.

## Modes
WP Motivator comes with five modes that can be applied separately to the features of the plugin:

* Innovator Mode
* Trailblazer Mode
* Innoblazer Mode (default)
* Customizer Mode
* Disabled Mode

## Greeting
The WP Motivator greeting appears before the user's name in the admin toolbar, both on the front end and in the admin.

## Message
The WP Motivator message is displayed at the top right of every admin page.

## Dashboard
There are two features available for use on the WordPress Dashboard page: a replacement for the native Welcome panel and a sortable dashboard widget.

## Footer
The WP Motivator footers display at the bottom of every admin page. It replace the default "Thank you for creating with WordPress" footer.

## Options
* Minimum user role for which the motivator features will display.
* Custom CSS to add your own styles to the various features.

## Languages
The content is included in translation functions but no translations from English are provided. One can add content in other languages by using the customizer mode. Greetings, however, only work with any of the English settings.
